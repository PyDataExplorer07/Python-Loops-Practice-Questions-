# Question 11: Display Fibonacci series up to 10 terms.
# Hint :- Have you ever wondered about the Fibonacci Sequence? Itâ€™s a series of numbers in which the next number is found by adding up the two numbers before it. The first two numbers are 0 and 1.

# For example, 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21. The next number in this series is 13 + 21 = 34.


# code :-

num1 = 0
num2 = 1

print("Fibonacci sequence : ")

for i in range(10):
    print(num1, end=' ')
    result = num1 + num2

    num1 = num2
    num2 = result
